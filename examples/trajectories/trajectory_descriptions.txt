Note the dimensions below are approximate only, test the trajectory in free space first.

shake
    presents hand and closes grip after about 5sec
pick_jar_top_in_front
    pick up a jar from the lid (palm facing down), located X=0, Y=~0.3 in front of robot. jar is ~15cm tall and lid ~7cm radius. Arm then moves the jar to the right and drops it.
lift_from_pinch
    makes a pinch grip at a location approximately X=0, Y=-0.7, Z=0.15, then lifts up
pick_obj_desk_surface
    picks up an object lying flat on desk at X=0.25, Y=-0.5. test object was a roll of tape ~7cm diameter, ~1.5cm high
pickup_bottle
    picks up a bottle from X=0.25, Y=-0.5. tested with bottle ~6cm diameter
remove_container_top
    attempt to grip and remove the lid of a small container by pulling straight upwards (contianer needs to be held in place). tested with plastic container with ~7x8cm lid. The location is at approximately X=0, Y=-0.75, Z=0.3.
take_pen
    presents hand to take pen and waits ~5sec before grasping. pen should be placed with the tip end resting against inside of middle finger and other end resting where thumb meets palm. after gripping, arm will move pen tip to desk surface at around X=0, Y=-0.6 and draw some arbitrary lines.
